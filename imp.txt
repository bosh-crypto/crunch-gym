As the 20th century dawned, the demand for more specialized equipment led to the creation <br/>
of innovative machines. One of the earliest such inventions was the Universal Gym Machine,<br/>
developed by Dr. Gustav Zander in the late 19th century. It featured a series of pulleys and <br/>
levers, allowing users to perform various exercises for different muscle groups. This marked a<br/>
significant shift toward the development of targeted workout machines.
